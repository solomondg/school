Meiosis is important for life in two ways. First is in sexual reproduction (which ties into the second way). Since each gamete only contains half the necessary chromosones for a "normal" diploid cell, such as the majority in most plants and animals, two gametes created by Meiosis (from different organisms of the same species) can be combined to form a unique diploid cell with the same number of chromosones as its two parent cells.
The second reason for its importance is its role towards promoting genetic diversity. Since the genes of the two parent cells are essentially mixed, the offspring has a combination of its parents' traits. This leads to increased genetic diversity over time, as instead of being exact clones (which leads to very low genetic diversity), an organism can have any mixture of its parents' traits.
