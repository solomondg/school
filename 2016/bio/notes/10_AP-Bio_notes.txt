Chapter 10 notes:

Intro:
Children are variations, not exact lones
Genetics = study of heridity
DNA and stuff

10.1

Inheritance of genes
Genes are parts of DNA
Reprodutive cells - gametes

Somatic cells - all cells except the gametes and their precursors

Locus: a gene's specific location on a chromosone

Asexual reproduction: single individual is sole parent and passes all genes to offspring w/o fusion of gametes
Single-celled eukaryotic organisms, for example

Sexual reproduction: two parents giing rise to offsprint w/ unique combination of genes

10.2

life cycle is generation to generation sequence o stages and stuff

Somatic cells: each has 46 chromosones
two chromosones, each of 23 types

when hromosones are arragned in pairs, it's called a karyotype
two identical chromosones called homologous chromosones

XY - sex chromosones

Any cell w/ two sets of chromosones is called a diploid cell
# of chromosones in a set is called n

for humans, diploid number is 46 (2n = 46)

Gametes, AKA haploid cells, only have 1 sets of chromosones

When haploid sperm is fused w/ haploid egg, it's called a zygote
diploid - 2 haploid sets of chromosones

meisosis - gamete production

Plants and some algae have 2nd life cycle - alternation of generations
both multicellular diploid and haploid life cyles
Diploid stage called sporophyte
Meiosis in that state creates spores
Two spores fusing creates a zygote, which is the next sporophyte generation

Sporophyte -> gametophyte -> sporophyte -> .....

Third type in most fungi and some protists/algae:
after fusioin of gametes, meiosis ours w/o multicellular diploid offspring developing
meiosis produces haploid cells (1 set of chromosones), which then divide by mitosis and make either unicellular deendants or a haploid multicellular adult organism
the haploid organism carries out further mitoses, making more cells that develop into gametes

Meiosis reduces the number of chromosone sets from diploid to haploid
two consecuitive cell divisions: Meiosis I and Meiosis II

Stages of Meiosis:

Meiosis I:
    Prophase I: Duplicated homologous chromosones exchange segments
    Metaphase I: Chromosones line up by homologous pairs
    Anaphase I: Each pair of homologous chromosones seperates
    Telophase I and Cytokinesis: Furrow appears, two haploid cells form
Meiosis II:
    Prophase II: Spindle forms, chromosones move towards metaphase II
    Metaphase II: Chromosones positioned at metaphase plate, b/c of crossing over in Meiosis I, the two sister chromosones aren't genetically identicale
    Anaphase II: sister chromatids pulled apart
    Telophase II and cytokinesis: Nuclei form, chromosones begain deondensing, cytokinesis occurs

10.4
Mechanic for genetic diversity is the rnadomness of ways the stuff can be distributed
Gametes each have drastically different gene combinations
Crossing over produces recombinant chromosones, which carry genes derieved from two different chromosone
In humans, 1-3 crossover events occur

Random nature of fertilazation also adds to the genetic variation

Advantage of sexual over asexual reproduction is genetic diversity
