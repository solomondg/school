Chromosone consists of a DNA molecule packed together with protiens
bacterial chromosone: one double-stranded circular DNA molecule associated w/ small amount of protien.
4.6 mil. nucleotide pairs in e coli
`1/1000` less than somatic
10x more than virus
supercoil - tight coil
eukaryotic dna combined with protein
called chromatin
chromatin coils and folds up in 1 condensed mass
some chromatin is present as 10 nm fiber, much is compacted into 30 nm fiber, which is sometimes folded and looped
iven in interphase, centromeres are condensed
that type is called heterochromatin (to distinguish from euchromatin)
heterochromatin is generally unavailable for dna transcription
chromosone is dynamic - can be modified
certain chem molecules modify structure
