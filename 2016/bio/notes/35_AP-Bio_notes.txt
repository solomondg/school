35: The Immune System
Pathogen: disease-causing

innate - barrier defenses
adaptive also
lysozyme (enzyme) acts as chem. defence

insects/invertabrates:
	hemocytes, essentially white blood cells
	phagocytosis

vertebrates:
barrier defenses: skin, mucus, etc
cellular innate defenses: phagocytic cells

TLR: Toll-like receptor

Neutrophils: attracted by infected tissue
Macrophages: Large phagocytic cell

dendric cells: stimulate adaptive immunity
eosinophils: discharge destructive enzymes

natural killer cells: circulate throughout body, detect virus and cancer cells, release chems. that lead to cell death

pathogen recognition triggers release of peptides

interferons: protiens that interfere w/ viral functions
complement system: ~30 protiens in blood plasma

inflammatory response: swelling
histamine, stored in mast cells near skin



35.2:
t and b cells - lymphocytes

thymus, organ above heart
any substance illicintg responce called antigen
epitope - antigenic determinant

4 polypeptide chains, 2 heavy 2 light

protien secreted called antibody

antigen recognition by t cells:
a chain and b chain
major histompatibility complex (MHC) molecule: host protien displaying fragment on cell surface

immunoioglobin gene:

proliferation of b/t cells:
effector cells: short lived that taker immediatelyt
plasma: secret antibodies
memory: long-lived can turn into effector
primary immune peaaks 10
secondary 2-7 days

35.3: active defends against infections

cytotoxin t cells: latch on and inject perforin

active immunityL arise when pathogens attack
passive: when antibodies produces by other individual

monoclonal antibodies: articifical-ish
immune rejection: accidentally foreign, similar to allergens

autoimmune: attacks own body

immune system avoidance:
antigeneitc variation: rapid changes in appearance
