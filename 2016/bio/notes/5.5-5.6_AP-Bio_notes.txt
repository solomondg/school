key terms:

& 5.5
Water and soluters enter and leave cell threough bilayer
diffuse
or transport protiens
large molecules are "packaged" in vesicles
requires energy

$ Exocytosis
Cell gives out molecules via fusion of vesicles w/ plasma membrane, called
exocytosis
transport vesicle goes from golgi apparatus to cytoskeleton to plasma membrane
vesicle membrane and plasma membrane touch, bilayers rearranged, membranes fuse
vesicle contents spill to outside of cell, then vesicle becomes part of cell wall
endocytosis
cell takes in molecules and particulate
forms new vesicles from plasma membrane

3 types of endocytosis
phagocytosis:
	cell engulfs particle by wrapping pseudopodie then packages w/ sack
called a food vacuole

pinocytosis:
	cell gradually takes in drops of extracellular fluid, obtaining
molecules inside the fluid

Receptor-meditated endocytosis
	type of pinocytosis, enables cell to take in bulk quantities
		specific substances only
	protien binds to solutes in extracellular fluid
	makes little "pits"
	forms vesicles

endo and exocytosis also helps remodel plasma membrane

& 5.6
Plasma membrane helps and is key in signaling
eukariotic cells can communicate through direct contact

local regulators:
	travels short distances, is a messenger molecule
	cells can simultneously accept and respond to the molecule of growth factor
		called paracrine signlaing
synaptic signaling:
	happens in animal nervous system
	electrical signaling, triggers neurotransmitter molecules, which
diffuse between nerve cell and target cell, triggering response

hormones for long-distance signaling, also called endocrine signaling in
animals
hormone molecules travel via circulatory system

3 stages of cell signaling:
	Reception  - target cell's detection of signaling molecule
	Transduction - Step(s) that transforms signal to form that
		can bring about cellular response, through
			Signal Transduction Pathway
	Response - almost any imagionable effect

$ Methods of Cell Signaling

Reception: binding of signaling molecule to receptor protien
plasma membrane plays strong role in signaling
local and long distance signaling
cell secrets regulator, diffuses trhough extracellular fluid
called paracrine signaling

Reception:
Signaling modeule attaches to receptor
molecule behaves as 'ligand', a molecule that specifically binds to another molecule
most receptors are plasma membrane protiens

receptor changes shape and relays molecules
G-protien coupled receptor: cell-surface, works w/ help of G-protien
binds to GTP, similar to ATP

ligand-gated ion channel
membrane receptor, has "gate" for ions
when signaling molecule binds, it opens gate
neurotransmitter molecules bind as ligands to ion channels

intracellular receptor
found in either cytoplasm or nucleus
chem. messinger passtes through cell's plasma, some hydrophobic molecules can
do so
includes thyroid and steroid hormones
testosterone travels through cell membrane into cells, but only
certain ones have the receptor
whjich brings it to nucleus and binds to specific genes
them stimulates gene to rna, which is translated into protien

transduction by cascades of molecular interactions
transduction usually
multistepoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
like following dominos
original signaling molecule usually doesn't even enter cell frequently

Protien Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are cellular mech. for regulatin
gprotien activity
enzyme that tansfers phosphate groups from ATP to protein is called Protien Kinase

protien phosphates, enzymes that can remove phosphate groups from protiens,
process called dephosphorylation
phosphates provide mechanism for turning off transduction pathway when initial
signal not present

second messengers: nonprotien, water-soluable molecules or ions
can be rapidly spread through diffusion
nnnnn                                        vvv      

Final step: response
Many turns on/off gene(s)
sometimes can regulate activity of protien instead of synthesis

evolution of cell signaling:
universal cellular regulation mechanisms
same small set of cell-signaling mechanisms in diverse species
