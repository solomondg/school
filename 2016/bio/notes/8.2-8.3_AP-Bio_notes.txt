8.2-8.3 notes

8.2
Light = photons, has properties of both particles and waves
two types of cholorphyl - alpha and beta
alpha - absorbs mainly blue-violet and red light
beta  - absorbs mainly 

electron in chlorophyl excited by light, releases photon and heat
two photosystems
electron goes in, through chain of chlorophyls, excites special pair, splitting of h2o excites other chlorophyl in pair, then excites rxn-center complex
electron then goes, helps form ATP from ADP + Pi, and can then either keep forming ATP or NADPH

can go into other photosystem (I), and excite second chlorophyl in pair (photon excites other)

ATP synthesis in Mitocondria and Chlorophyl very alike
Electrons in ETC made from organic molecules in M and from water in C
ATP-synthase makes ATP by pumping protons (H+ ions) into thylakoid space/inner-membrane space, which drives ATP-synthase as they diffuse out

8.3
G3P - sugar made by calvin cycle

calvin cycle:
1. 3 CO2 molecules, each are affixed to 1 RuBP. RuBP breaks down, into total of 6 (2 from each) 3-Phosphoglycerate molecules
2. each 3-P molecule gets +1 phosphate group from ATP, becomes 1,3-biphosphoglycerate, then gets electron from NADPH, also losing a phosphate group, and 1,3-B becomes G3P (6 G3P in total), and 1 G3P exits cycle, rest break down back into RuBP from donation of ATP phosphate group

In most plants, initial fixation of carbon is via Rubisco, plants called C3 plants b/c first organic product of carbon fixation is a 3 carbon compound
Some desert and arid plants turn CO2 into organic acid during day then back into CO2 during night to avoid drying out stomata

C4 plants have 2 seperate cells to do this, CAM plants have 1 combined.
