Chromatin - Entire complex of DNA and protiens that make up chromosones
Sister chromatid cohesion - two sister chromatids (duplicated copies of original chromosone) attached to each other
Cytokinesis - division of the cytoplasm
Interphase - cell state when not undergoing miosis and/or cytokinesis
    G1 phase (first gap)
    G2 phase (second gap)
    S phase (synthesis)
Mitotic Spindle - structure consisted of microtubules and protiens
Aster - radial array of microtubules, extends from centrosome
Kinetochore - protien structure, one on each sister chromatid
clevage furrow - shallow groove on cell surface starting to cinch the cell to make two smaller ones
Binary fission - bacteria asexual reproduction
origin of replication - place on bacteria chromosone where replication starts
Cell Cycle Control System - cyclic set of molecules that triggers and coordinates key events in the cell cycle
Checkpoint - control point where stop and go signals can influence the cell cycle
G0 Phase - if signal isn't recieved, cell can go into G0 phase and not replicate/whatever
Growth Factor - Protien released by cell to stimulate others to divide.
Density-dependent inhibition - Phenomenon where crowded cells stop deviding
Anchorage dependence - Most animal cells must be attached to a substratum: inside of culture flask or extracellular matrix of a tissue
Benign tumor - (cancer) cells have too many anomalies to leave initial spot
Malignant tumor - (cancer) cells that can spread to other tissues
Metastasis - spread of cancer cells to locations away from the initial location

Phases of cell cycle:
Interphase
Miotic Phase:
    Prophase
    Prometaphase
    Metaphase
    Anaphase
    Telophase
    Cytophase

Interphase:
    G1:
        Growth
    S:
        Synthesis of second pair of chromosones and stuff
    G2: More growth

Prophase:
    Chromatin condenses, nucleolus disappears

Prometaphase:
    Nuclear Membrane breaks down, microtubules latch onto Kinetochores, start pulling apart

Metaphase:
    Chromosones line up at equator

Anaphase:
    Chromosones break at centomeres and move to opposite ends of cell

Telophase:
    Cleavage furrow appears, nuclear membrane reforms, chromosones turn back into chromatin, nucleoli reappear

Cytophase:
    Cell completely splits
