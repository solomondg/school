Personally, I don't think that I have anywhere close to the amount of economic knowlage to debate Keynesian vs. Classical (Supply vs Demand-side) economics. Personally, I feel like Keynesian economics is more accurate. Lots of government social assistance leads to more spending on a wider range of objects, which leads to more employment, which leads to higher inflation, which leads to more spending and investment. But then again, I barely know what I'm talking about.
