T: "Trust me, I know"
B: "B-b-but s-sir! I w-would never d-dream--"
T: "Sir, with all due respect, you're a terrible liar."
B: "I'm not lying! Please, sir!"
T: "_I_'m not going to punish you. I'm just disappointed"
B: "But I've never done anything! I'm just a loyal tradesman!"
T: "Yep."
B: "Sir, what have I done? H-how could you--- I mean, why are you accusing me?"
T: "Do you really think nobody notices even how uncomfortable you always look around us?"
B: "I'm just trying to show my loyalty!"
T: "Right. It's not like you ever check for anyone following you when you scamper off to your friends every time you see me."
B: "I-i-... How much do you know?"
T: "Shouldn't I be asking you the same thing?"
B: "..."
T: "Well, at least you're done playing dumb. You know, I must commend you, you give a good shave."
B: "How much do you know?"
T: "I hardly think you're in a position to ask me questions right now. But I'll just say this --- quite a bit."
B: "How."
T: "How? After a few of those demonstrations you so enjoyed, some of your friends were happy to have a little chat with us. We don't just do them for the shock value, you know."
B: "..."
T: "I see you holding that razor. I don't think you have it in you, but if you want to try again, I'll need a shave when I get back from.... hunting again."
B: "How did you know I wouldn't kill you?"
T: "As I said, it takes more than I thought you had in you. Next time, if you're gonna try to kill someone, do your job. Nobody likes a quitter."
