My love is like that of a literary analysist
    It's drawn to things that are straightforward and honest
My love is like a faulty lie detector
    It's really annoying when someone skirts what they're trying to say

Overall the one thing I know
    Usually expressed without metaphor or flow
The one thing that'll come close to driving it up a tree
    Is overtly flowery poetry
