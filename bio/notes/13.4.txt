13.4 Understandfing DNA structure and repliactaiton makes gneetic nregineering possible

nucleic acid hybridazation - one strand of nucleic acid pairing to similar one
forms basis of genetic engineering

DNA cloning:
Plasmids: small circular DNA molecules, replicate seperately from chromosone
Can insert genes into plasmids for protien productin in bacteria
Recombinant DNA: Dna from 2 species combined in lab
Gene cloning: making multiple copies of one gene:
can use to amplify or produce protien

using restriction enzymes to make recombinant DNA:
restictuon enzymes: cutting and stuff DNA
restriction site: specific string of DNA to be cut
restriction fragments: many cut pieces of DNA
gel electrophoresis: sorting DNA by length
sticky end: single-stranded end, can bond  with other sticky ends
cloning vector: DNA that can carry foreign DNA into host cell then replcicate
