mutations: changes in genetic code
point mutations - changes in single nucleotide pair
if negative: heridatary disease or genetic disorder

substitutions:
nucleotide-pair substitution: replacement of one nuc. pair with another
silent mutation: no change (CCG to CCA, for example)
missense mutations: one amino acid to another

nonsense mutation: codon into stop codon - nonsense mutation

insetion and deletion
adding or removing nucleotides - frequently disasterous

happens when number of things inseted or removed % 3 != 0
