15.1
Bacteria often respond to environmental change by regulating transcription

nat. selection favors bacteria that regulates production based on needs

operon model: many genes switched on and off based on metabolic habits
single transcription usit for tryptophan in E. coli
when e coli must make trypotophan b/c medium lacks amino acid, all enzymes are synthesized at one time
the switch is a seg. of dna called an operator
controls the access of rna-polymerase to genes
the entire cluster of on/off switch + enzyme coding segments is an operon
if trp is turned on, rna polymerase can bind to promoter & transcribe the genes
operon can be switched off by trp-repressor protien
repressor binds to operator, blocking attachment of rna polymerase
trp repressor is protein product of a regulatory gene, called trpR
located distance from the trp operon and has own promoter
regulatorary genes are expressed continuously  (low rate), few trp repressor always present in e coli
operator alternates between having and not having repressor
relative duration of repressed state is higher when more active repressor molecules are present
trp repressor has 2 shapes - active and inactive
symthesized in inactive
if trypophan binds to trp repressor, repressor changes from active form that can attach to operator, turns it off


repressible & inductible operons:
trp operon is repressable - transcription usually on, but can be inhibited
inductible usually off, but can be turned on

repressible enzymes are usually in anabolic pathways -- synthesizing essential end products from raw materials
inductible enyzmes are usually in catabolic pathways -- breaking down nutrient to simplet molecules
cell avoids wasting energy by only producing when applicable

positive gene regulation:
only when lactose is present and glucose is in short supply does e. coli use lactose as energy source

cyclic AMP - cAMP
accumulates when glucose is scarce
CAP - catabolite activator protein
is activator - protein that binds to DNA and stimulates transcription of gene
when camp binds to CAP, it assumes active shape and can attach to lac promoter and increase rna-polymerase's affinity for the promoter
if gluecose increases, cAMP falls, and CAP detatches from operons
CAP heps regulate other metabolic operons
may affect expression of more than 100

15.2
eukaryotic gene expression is regulated at many stages
differential gene exptressioin:
expression of different genes by cells w/ same genome
function of cell determines on set of genes being expressed

regulation of chromatin structure:

histone modification and dna methylation:
chem modifications to histones play direct role in gene transcription
n-terminus in nucleosom protrudes outward
histone acelation promotes transcription by opening up chromatin
when enzymes methelate the tails of histone protiens, different set can methylate certtain bases in dna tself
dna methylation: 
occurs in most living things
long stretches of inactive dna is usaully more methalated
epigenetic inheritance:

regulation of transcripotion initiation:
chromatin modifying enzymes provide initial control of gene expression

organization - typical eukary gene
transcription initiation complex - upsteam of promoter
control elements - noncoding dna w/ binding sites for transcription factors

role of transcription factors:
to initiate transcription, eukary. RNA requires assitance of transcription factors -- some are essential for all protein-coding, called "general transcription factors"
general transcription factors + rna polymerase II = low amount of transcription
has to have additional specific transcription factors (more protiens)

enhancers and specific transcription factors:
proximal control elements - located close to the promoter
more distant distal control elements (groupings of which are called enhancers)
any gene may have multiple control elements
in eukaryotes, rate of gene expression strong increases/decreases binding specific trans. factors


mechanics of post-transcriptional regulation:

rna processing:
rna processing in nucleis and export in cytoplasm
alternative rna splicing - different mols. produced from same transcript depending on splicing

mRNA degration:
bacterial mrna is degraded within few minutes
in eukaryotes - minutes, hours, days, weeks

initiation of translation:
regulatory protiens can block specific sequences or structures in 5 or 3 utr
    prevents attachments of ribisomes

protien processing and degration:
