3.5-3.6

key terms:
polypeptides
side chain
peptide bond

& 3.5
Proteins include a diversity of structures and functions

Comes from greek word _proteios_, meaning first or primary
>50% dry mass of cells
Function of organisms

Can speed up chem rxns, immune syste, transport, communication, movement, structural support
can be catalysts

enzymes:
regulates metabolism, are catalysts
can perform function over and over

humans have tens of thousands of unique protiens
unique 3d shape

Types of protiens:
Enzymatic - accelerates select chem. rxns
Storage - stors amino acids
Hormonal - coordinates organism's activities
Contractile & Motor - moves
Defensive - protects against pathogens
Transport - transports substances
Receptor - responses of cell to chem. stimuli
Structural - support

Proteins are made of polypeptides
contains one or more polypeptides, folds into specific 3d shape

$ Amino Acids
Polypeptides are made of amino acids
20 diferent ones
common structure
amino acid is organic mol. w/ amino and carboxyl group

Common structure:
H   R   O
 \  |  //
  N-C-C
 /  ^  \
H   |   OH
    alpha carbon

R = R Group = Side Chain
4 partners to alpha carbon are amino group, carboxyl group, H atom, and R group
Side chain differs per acid

Can be nonpolar/hydrophobic, polar/hydrophilic, and electrically charged/hydrophilic side chains

r group can be super simple or complex

$ Polypeptides
two amino acids, carboxyl in first adjacent to amino in second
dehydration reaction
covalent bond formed called peptide bond

repeating sequence of amino-alpha carbon-hydroxyl-peptide bond-amino.... called polypeptide backbone
can be anywhere from 3 to 1000+ amino acids
each specific polypeptide has unique sequence of acids
one side of polypeptide has amino end, called N-terminus, other side had carboxyl end, called C-terminus
side chains outnumber terminuses, so behaivor is dictated by chains

$ Protein Structure and Function
polypeptide != protien
yarn != sweater

protien  = multiple polypeptide chains folded

amino acid dictates how protien folds

protien chain folds spontaniously

some protiens spherical (globular protiens)
some protiens like long fibers (fibrous protiens)

protien specific structure determines how it works
can match shapes (endorphin, morphene) to fit into brain receptors like lock & key
antibodies match to forign substances
emegent property

$ Four Levels of Protien Structure
All protiens share 3 superimposed levels of structure:
    Primary
    Secondary
    Teritary
when protien  = 2+ polypeptide chains, there's also
    Quatrnary

primary structure = sequence of amino acids
Secondary structure = coils and folds - regions stablalized by hydrogen bonds between polypeptide backbone atoms
    alpha heix - coil held together by hydrogen bond between every 4th amino acid
    beta pleated sheet - two or more segments of polypeptide next to eacheother, called beta segments, connected by hydrogen bonds across parallel segments of backbone
teritary structure = 3d strucutre stabelized by side chain interactions
    hydrophobic interaction - amino acids with hydrophobic/nonpolar side chains end up in clusters at protien core
        held together w/ van der waals interactions
    disulfide bridges - two cysteine monomers w/ sulhydryl groups are brought close together - sulfur bonds to sulfer and it rivits part of protien together
Quaternary Structure - overall protien structure w/ multiple polypeptides

Denaturation: when protien unravles and loses natural shape
many denature when transfirred from aqueous environment to nonpolar solvent
also high temps and some chem rxns
jloses ability to function
can sometimes renature when chem and phys aspects restored to normal


$ Protien folding in cell
X-ray crystallography - makes 3d model

& 3.6

$ Roles of Nucleic Acids
Amino acid sequence of polypeptide = gene
genes consist of dna
memes
dna and rna
deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid
dna provides directions for replication and rna synthesis
rna provides protien synthesis
chromosone contains one long dna molecule
dna = computer, rna = machine/printer
dna -> rna -> protien
each gene on dna directs synthesis of messenger RNA, or mRNA, which interacts with protien syntehsizing material to make a protien
carries from nucleus to cytoplasm
other types of rna as well

$ Components of Nucliec Acids
nucliec acids are macromolecules and polymers called polynucleotides
consiting of monomers called nucleotides
composed of 3 parts: nitrogenous (nitrogen-carrying) base, 5 carbon sugar (pentose), and one or more phosphate groups

each monomer has 1 phosphate group
portion w/o groups called nucleoside

two families of nitrogenous bases: pyrimidines and purines
pyrimidine has 1 six-membered ring of carbon and nitrogen, Cytosine, Thymene, and Uracil
Purine is larger, 6-membered fused to 5-membered, purines = Adenine and Guanine
Adenine, guanine, and cytosine found in both, Thymine and Uracil found only in DNA and RNA, respectively
in dna the sugar on nitrogen. base is deoxyribose, on RNA it's ribose
deoxy lacks O atom on 2nd carbon in ring

to diff. numbers of sugar atoms from ring atoms of nitro. base, use prime symbol

add phosphate group to 5` carbon of sugar
molecule is now nucleoside monophosphate, aka nucleotide

$ Nucleotide Polymers
adjacent nucleotides joined by a phosphodiester linkage
consists of phosphate group binding sugars of 2 nucleotides
binding results in backbone w/ repeating pattern of sugar-phosphate units
one end of polymer has phosphate on 5` carbon, ther has hydroxyl on 3` carbon, refered to as 5` and 3` end.
polynucleotide has built in directionality along sugat-phosphate bacbone
from 5` to 3`
all along backbone are nitrogenous base appendages

sequence of bases along dna or mRNA is unique for each gene
linear order of bases specifies amino acid sequence and therefore primary structure of a proten, specifying protien's 3d structure and cell function
