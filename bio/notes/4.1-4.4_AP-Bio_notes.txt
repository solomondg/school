key terms:

& 4.1
$ Microscopy

Light microscope uses light
Electron microscope uses electrons
SEM = scanning electron microscopy
makes 3d shapes
TEM = Transmission Electron Microscopy
2d shapes

cell fractionation
broken cells put in centrifuge
seperates out parts

$ 4.2
organelles
prokariotic cells don't have nucleus, just free-floating dna clump

interior of cell called cytoplasm
plasma membrane - selective barrier

organelles:
flagellum: long fibers for movement

Centrosome: looks like --| or a T, region where cell's microtubules are initiated
    not in plant cells

peroxisome: various specalized metabolic functions, creates h2o2
mitochrondrion: where cellular respiration occurs, generates most ATP
lysosome: digestive, macromolecules hydrolysed
golgi apparatus: synthesis, modification, sorting, and secretion of cell products
plasma membrane: membrane enclosing the cell
ribosomes: makes protiens, bound to rough er or free
nucleus:
    nuclear envelope: double membrane around nucleus, perforated by pores, continuous w/ ER
    Nucleolus: nonmemranous structure, propduces ribosomes, nucleus has one or more nucleoli
    Chromatin: material consisiting of dna and protiens
        visible as individual dividing chromosones in dividing cell
endoplasmic reticulum: network of membranous sacs and tubes, membrane synthesis, other processes, has rough and smooth regions
central vacuole: holds plant cell shape, hydrolysis of macromolecules, stores water
chloroplast: photosynthesis, sunlight -> sugar
plasmodesmata: plant channels through and between plant cells
cell wall: outer layer of cell - PLANTS ONLY
cytoskeleton: reinforces cell shape, helps movement

$ 4.3
nucleus contains most of eukaryoitc genes, some in mitocondria & chloroplasts
inside of double membrane / pores lined w;/ nuclear lamina, protien filament netlike arrayy, keeps shape of nucleus
chromatin - dna and protien smaking up chromosone
ribosomes:
carry out protien synthesis
two locations: free ribosomes suspended in cytosol, bound ribosomes on outside of ER or nuclear envolope
structurally identical
free ones generally make enzymes to catalyse sugar
bound generally makes protiens for mebrane insertion or packaging within things like lysosomes

$ 4.4
endomembrane system - consists of nuclear envelope, golgi apparatus, lysosomes, ER, plasma membrane, and various types of vesicles and vacuoles
membranes related through touching or transfer of membrane segments as tiny membrane sacs called vesicles

Endoplasmic Reticulum/Biosynthetic Factory
ER accounts for 1/2 total membrane
consists of network of tubules and sacs called cisternae
smooth er and rough er
smooth lacks ribosomes, rough has them
smooth ER:
    synthesis of lipids
    filtering of drugs and poisions/detoxification
    storage of calcium
    metabolism of carbohydrates
rough ER:
    synthesis of lipids

golgi apparatus:
"shipping and recieving center"
recieves transport vesicles with protiens in them
membranes of cisternao on opposite sides differing in thickness & molecular composition
called the cis face adn trans face
recieveing and shipping respectively
producs of ER usually modified between cis and trans faces
golgi can remove and substitute some sugars, and phosopholipids
also manufactures some molecules
    polysaccharides - many are produced by golgi

lysosomes:
membrane sac of hydrolytic enzymes
animal cell uses to digest macromolecules
works best in acidic environment
