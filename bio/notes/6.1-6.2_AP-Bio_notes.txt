metabolism - totality of organism's chem rxns

metabolic pathway: starting molecule through rxns and enzymes becomes product

some metabolic pathways release energy
complex molecule -> simple molecule
called catabolic pathways
cellular respiration, for example. glucose + o2 -> co2 + h2o

anabolic pathways consume energy to build complex molecules from simple ones
example: synthesis of amino acid from simple molecules
cantabolic and anabolic downhill and uphill respectively

bioenergetics: how energy flows through organisms

$ Forms of Energy
energy is capacity to cause change

well then i guess tumblr feminists don't have very much energy
heh
ha... ha...
yeah.


kinetic energy - relative motion
thermal energy - kinetic energy w/ random atomic motion
thermal energy in transfer is called heat
potential energy - location or structure potential
chemical energy - potential energy in molecular bonds

Study of metabolism
goal is to determine occuring rxns
delta G = G sub final state - G sub initial state
          (free energy of)    (free energy of)
glucose into co2 and h2o has delta g of -686 kcal

negative G - system must lose free energy
free energy kinda like measure of system stability
chem equilibrium: forward & reverse reactions happening at same rate

process is spontanious and can only perform work when it is moving towards equlibrium

$ Free Energy and Metabolism

chem reactions can be classified as exergonic (energy outward) or endergonic (energy inward)
exergonic rxn has net release of free energy

b/c chem mixture loses energy, delta G is negative for exergonic reactions that occur spontaniously

endergonic rxn takes in energy
stores in molecules, g increases
if chem rxn is downhill then reverse must be uphill

plants get energy to convert co2 and h2o to glucose from sunlight

$ Equilibrium and Metabolism
Rxns in isolated system reach equilibrium
chem rxns of metabolism are reversable
would reach qeuilibrium if in isolated test tube
metabolism never at equilibrium - defining feature of life
living cell not at equilibrium
catabolic pathway - releases free energy in series of rxns

& 6.3

cell does 3 kinds of work
chemical work - endergonic rxns that wouldn't be spontanious like synthesis of polymers from momers

transport work like moving substances
mechanical work like beating of cilia and muscle cell contraction and chromosone movement

cells manage their energy w/ key feature - energy coupling
use of exergonic process to drive endergonic one
ATP mediates most energy coupling in cells and usually acts as cellular source of energy

$ Structure and Hydrolysis of ATP:

ATP - adenosine triphosphate
contains ribose w/ nitrogenous base adenine and chain of 3 phosphate groups
bonded to it
also one of the RNA nucloeside triphosphates
binds between ATP phosphate groups can be broken w/ hydrolysis
when it is bonded, inorganic phosphate leaves ATP
leaves adenosine diphosphate (ADP)
releases 7.3 kcal per mol of ATP

atp important b/c energy it releases upon phosphate group removal is greater than energy other molecules could deliver
ATP triphosphate tail like spring
lots of negative charged atoms in ATP

$ How the Hydrolysis of ATP Performs Work

Cell can use heat from atp rxn to power other rxns

atp sometimes transfers phosphate group to other molecule like reactant
recipient called Phosphorylated Intermediate
overall exergonic rxn if atp + other rxn

transport and mechanical powered by atp hydrolysis
leads to change in protien shape and often ability to bind to other molecules
