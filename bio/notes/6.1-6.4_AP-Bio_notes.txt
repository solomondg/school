metabolism - totality of organism's chem rxns

metabolic pathway: starting molecule through rxns and enzymes becomes product

some metabolic pathways release energy
complex molecule -> simple molecule
called catabolic pathways
cellular respiration, for example. glucose + o2 -> co2 + h2o

anabolic pathways consume energy to build complex molecules from simple ones
example: synthesis of amino acid from simple molecules
cantabolic and anabolic downhill and uphill respectively

bioenergetics: how energy flows through organisms

$ Forms of Energy
energy is capacity to cause change

well then i guess tumblr feminists don't have very much energy
heh
ha... ha...
yeah.


kinetic energy - relative motion
thermal energy - kinetic energy w/ random atomic motion
thermal energy in transfer is called heat
potential energy - location or structure potential
chemical energy - potential energy in molecular bonds

Study of metabolism
goal is to determine occuring rxns
delta G = G sub final state - G sub initial state
          (free energy of)    (free energy of)
glucose into co2 and h2o has delta g of -686 kcal

negative G - system must lose free energy
free energy kinda like measure of system stability
chem equilibrium: forward & reverse reactions happening at same rate

process is spontanious and can only perform work when it is moving towards equlibrium

$ Free Energy and Metabolism

chem reactions can be classified as exergonic (energy outward) or endergonic (energy inward)
exergonic rxn has net release of free energy

b/c chem mixture loses energy, delta G is negative for exergonic reactions that occur spontaniously

endergonic rxn takes in energy
stores in molecules, g increases
if chem rxn is downhill then reverse must be uphill

plants get energy to convert co2 and h2o to glucose from sunlight

$ Equilibrium and Metabolism
Rxns in isolated system reach equilibrium
chem rxns of metabolism are reversable
would reach qeuilibrium if in isolated test tube
metabolism never at equilibrium - defining feature of life
living cell not at equilibrium
catabolic pathway - releases free energy in series of rxns

& 6.3

cell does 3 kinds of work
chemical work - endergonic rxns that wouldn't be spontanious like synthesis of polymers from momers

transport work like moving substances
mechanical work like beating of cilia and muscle cell contraction and chromosone movement

cells manage their energy w/ key feature - energy coupling
use of exergonic process to drive endergonic one
ATP mediates most energy coupling in cells and usually acts as cellular source of energy

$ Structure and Hydrolysis of ATP:

ATP - adenosine triphosphate
contains ribose w/ nitrogenous base adenine and chain of 3 phosphate groups
bonded to it
also one of the RNA nucloeside triphosphates
binds between ATP phosphate groups can be broken w/ hydrolysis
when it is bonded, inorganic phosphate leaves ATP
leaves adenosine diphosphate (ADP)
releases 7.3 kcal per mol of ATP

atp important b/c energy it releases upon phosphate group removal is greater than energy other molecules could deliver
ATP triphosphate tail like spring
lots of negative charged atoms in ATP

$ How the Hydrolysis of ATP Performs Work

Cell can use heat from atp rxn to power other rxns

atp sometimes transfers phosphate group to other molecule like reactant
recipient called Phosphorylated Intermediate
overall exergonic rxn if atp + other rxn

transport and mechanical powered by atp hydrolysis
leads to change in protien shape and often ability to bind to other molecules

mechanical work:
powered by hydrolysis of ATP
atp hydrolysis leads to change in protien's shape and ability to bind to other molecules
cycle:
atp binded noncovalently to motor protien
then, atp hydrolysed, releasing adp and pi
then another atp molecule can bind
resulting in movement along cytoskeletal track
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation promote protien shape changes during cell signaling

& 6.4
Enzymes speed up metabolic reactions by lowering energy barriers
solutionof sucrose dissolved in sterile water will sit for years at room temp w/o appreciable hydrolysys
small amount of the enzime sucrase will hydrolyse the sugar within seconds

$ The Activation Energy Barrier
activation energy = Ea/E sub a
activation energy frequently supplied as heat
no hi temps in cells - denature protiens
enzymes lower activation energy needed
reactant an enzyme acts on is called a substrate
enzime binds to substrate (or substrates) and forms an enzyme-substrate complex
  
enzyme + substrate(s) <-> enzyme-substrate complex <-> enzyme + product(s)

Only restricted region of enzyme binds to substrate
region called Active Site
typically pocket or groove on enzyme where catalysis occurs
As substrate enters active site, enzyme changes shape slightly
Shape change makes active site fit more snugly around substrate
CAlled Induced Fit
Enhances ability to catalyse the chem. rxn.

$ Catalysis in Enzyme's Active Site
Substrate held by weak bonds
hydrogen and ionic
R groups of a few amino acids that make up active site catalyze the conversion of substrate to product
most metabolic rxns are reversible
enzyme can catalyze either forward or reverse rxn, depending on which has negative delta g
depends mainly on relative concentrations of reactants and products
net effect always in direction of equlibrium

methods of lowering activation energy & speed up rxn:
    active site provides template for which multiple substrates can come together in proper orientation
    enzyme may stretch substrate towards transition state form
    active site may provide a microenvironment, more conductive to particular type of rxn
        example: if active site has amino w/ acidic r groups, active site may be pocket of low ph in neutral cell
    direct parcitipitation of active site in chem rxn
        sometimes process involves brief covalent bonding between substrate and side chain of enzyme amino acid

$ Effects of local conditons on enzime activity
activity/efficiency of enzime is affected by general environmental factors such as temperature and PH
each enzime has optimal temp.
mose have temp of 35-40*C

many enzymes require nonprotien cofactors
may be bound tightly to enzyme or bind losely and reversably to substrate
cofactors of some are inorgamic, such as zinc, iron, copper
if cofactor is organic, it's called coenzyme
most viatmins act as coenzymes or raw materials making up coenzymes

Enzyme Inhibittors
certain chemicals inhibit action of specific enzymes
some inhibitors resemble substrate and compete for admission to active site
called competitive inhibitors
reduce productivity of inhibitors
noncompetitive inhibitors don't compete, just impede by binding to another part
causes enzyme molecule to change shape so active site is less effective
toxins and poisons are irreversable inhibitors
sarin, nerve gas, binds to r group on serine, which is found on acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme important to the nervous system
DDT adn parathion as well
many antibiotics are inhibitors
