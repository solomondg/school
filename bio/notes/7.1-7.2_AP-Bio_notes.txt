Glycolysis - glucose -> pyruvate
Glucose is split into two 3-carbon sugars, which are then oxydized and rearranged to form Pyruvate
two phases: energy investment and energy payoff
         spends ATP ^           gets ATP ^

Each glucose molecule gives 2 ATP and 2 NADH from glycolysis
no carbon released as co2 during glycolysis - all in the pyruvate
also needs no 02

& 7.3
citric acid cycle:
glycolysis releases less than 1/4 energy
most remains in the pyruvate
if o2 is present, pyruvate enters mitocondria, where oxy. of glucose finishes
happens in cytosol for procaryotic cells (bacteria)
citric acid cycle AKA krebs cycle
cycle has 8 steps
each has specific enzyme
turns Acetyl CoA into NADH, CO2, FADH2, and ATP (from ADP + Pi)
