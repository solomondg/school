Glycolysis releases <25% of chem. energy in Glucose

Oxydative Phosphorylation:
Electron transport chain
    most components protiens, are in multiprotien complexes numbered I through IV
    Series of Redox rxns
    Pump protons through mitocondrial wall to the intermembrane space
    protons go down the gradient back into mitocondria through ATP-Synthase
    which consists of the following parts:
        Rotor
        Stator
        Internal Rod
        Catalytic Knob
    chemiosmosis

    --chemiosmisis is an energy-coupling mechanism that uses energy stored in the form of an H+ gradient across a membrane to drive cellular work.

fermentation:
fermentation doesn't use o2 or ETC
two types of fermentation:
alcohol and lactic acid

alcohol:
    pyruvate converted to ethanol
    first, co2 is released from pyruvate, then pyruvate is converted to acetaldehyde
    the, acetaldehyde is reduced by NADH to ethanol
    yeast carries out alcohol fermentation, for example
lactic acid:
    pyruvate reduced directly to lactate, no co2 release
    used to make cheese and yogurt
    also by human cells when o2 is scarse
fermentation yields 2 ATP molecules

versatility of catabolism:
free glucose is not a common molecule in foods
glycolysis can accept wide range of carbohydrates
starch is hydrolyzed to glucose
glycogen can be hydrolysed to glucose
sucrose as well
protiens can be used as glucose, same w/ fats

fats:
    digested to glycerol + fatty acids
    glycerol -> glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
    metabolic sequence called Beta Oxidation breaks fatty acids down into 2 carbon acids
    enter citric acid cycle as Acetyl CoA.
    1 gram of fat produces >2x as much ATP as a gram of carbohydrates

biosynthesis:
cells must also get carbon skeletons
amino acids from hydrolysis of protiens can be incorperated into organism's protiens
humans make ~50% of amino acids by modifying compounds from citric acid cycle
the rest are "essential amino acids," must be obtained from food
glucose can be made from pyruvate and fatty acids from acetyl CoA, using ATP
even 100% fat free diets can still store fats
    intermediate compound, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, can be used to create a major precursor to fat
energy is released, not produced, by cellular respiration
