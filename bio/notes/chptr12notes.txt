Chromosomal basis of inheritance

12.1 mendelian inheritance has its physical basis in the behavior of chromosones

chromosome theory of inheritence
mendelian genes have specific loci (positions) along chromosones and it's the chromosones that undergo segregation and independant assortment

12.2 Sex-linked genes have unique inheritence patterns
x-chromosones have many genes that determine sex-unrelated characters
most of one x chromosones in all female mammals are inactive
inactive one condenses into Barr body - most of genes not expressed
happens randomly

12.3 linked genes tend to be inherited together due to their position on chromosone
closer genes are more likely to be inherited together.

parental types - phenotype that matches one of the two parental phenotypes

recombinant types/recombinants - offspring different from one of the parents

50% recombination frequency in genes located on different chromosones/unlinked

linkage map - genetic map based on recombination frequencies
map units - distance between genes; 1% recombination frequency

cytogenic maps - genes location with respect to chromosal features (stained bands, etc)

12.4 Genetic Disorders

nondisjunction - members of pair of homologous chromosones fail to move apart

if one of the aberrant gametes unites w/ normal one, the condition is called aneuploidyzzzz
monosomy = zygote having 2n-1 chromosones
trisomy = zygote having 2n+1 chromosones

polyplody - more than two complete chromosomal sets in 1 cell

deletion - chromosone part is lost
duplication - deleted part attches to other segment

inversion - reattaching in inverse orientation
translocation - joining a nonhomologous chromosone
