8. With demand, less demand overall means less demand for the labor to make the demanded products, as well as labor itself. Price-level outcome: lower prices (ignoring drop in demand). With supply, less agg. supply can lead to lower employment as employment is a component of supply.
9. In the 1990s and 2000s, demand was up and supply was up due to cheap oil prices and govt. spending from war in afganistan. A recession could happen due to the drop in prices due to consumer expectations, and saving instead of consuming.
