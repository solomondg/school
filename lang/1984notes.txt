Newspeak:
Removes possibility of rebellious thought
Simplifies language
"doubleplusungood"
No nuance/flexibility

Winston:
Ordinary, becomes aware of his situation
Yearns for understanding
Rebellious

Julia:
Less caring about long term goals
Only person Winston can trust

O'Brien:
Able to trick Winston (too trusting?)
At end of book, hints about him still being rebellious

Setting:
1984 (duh)
London
Oceana/Airstrip One

Themes:
Totalitarianism
Language & Language vs thought


War is Peace <- Constant war brings about patriotism and removes economic surplus
Freedom is Slavery <- Dissuasion to seek freedom, plus saying that being free is to submit to your own desires (Junior Anti-Sex League and the like is an example)
Ignorance is Strength <- Dissuades to seek information, also means that the peoples' ignorance == the country's strength


- Connections to modern society, tech-based totalitarianism

Published 1949

Annotations:

Telescreen: Julius Vernes-like future prediction, interesting how accurate

How did the political system in 1949 influence this book?

Doublethink: Actual concept irl?
Generally downtrodden city
Generally menial jobs
2050 newspeak -- not much example of it given
can language really influence thought?
sexuality as a theme / control force
Freedom to think, thought police
Prole uprising, why motivation

Winston & Julia both opposite but similar
Winston afraid of rats -- foreshadowing, hinting at listening devices?
Rarity in crystal ball -- center untouchable coral = winston's problems, wants to know past but too many obstacles
To write, a writer must think fearlessly
Winston pessimest, julia optimist
Crystal ball -- eternity passage -- only eternal is big brother

Ampleforth caught - leaving god in book, political statement?

Winston caught, 'rats' julia out
MiniLov - no darkness (lights always on)
Winston broken of love
Obrien betrayer, but shows a shred of free thought
Doublethink hard to learn
Party's objective - control all thought
2 + 2 = 5 : shows the party can control someone
Doublethink: Obrien as only friend but torturer
Futility of anti party: they'd been watching
Betrays julia

Ending scene: Winston as model citizen, full totalitarianism, winston self convinced his memories are false
Diction + speech of party, Julia and him repeat eachother's phrases
Literature impossible under totalitarianism?
