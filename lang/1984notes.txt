Themes:
Totalitarianism
Language


War is Peace <- Constant war brings about patriotism and removes economic surplus
Freedom is Slavery <- Dissuasion to seek freedom, plus saying that being free is to submit to your own desires (Junior Anti-Sex League and the like is an example)
Ignorance is Strength <- Dissuades to seek information, also means that the peoples' ignorance == the country's strength


- Connections to modern society, tech-based totalitarianism
