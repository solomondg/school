"B-b-but s-sir! I w-would never d-dream--"
"Sir, with all due respect, you're a terrible liar."
"I'm not lying! Please, sir!"
"_I_'m not going to punish you. I'm just disapointed"
"But I've never done anything! I'm just a loyal tradesman!"
"Sir, what have I done? H-how could you know-- I mean, why are you accusing me?"
"Do you really think nobody notices how uncomfortable you always look around us?"
"I'm just trying to show my loyalty!"
"Cut the crap. It's not like you ever check for anyone following you when you scamper off to your friends every time you see me."
