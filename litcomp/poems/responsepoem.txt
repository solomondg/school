Response to Shappy(?)

Your superior intellect makes you above all?
If so then you'd know,
No knowlage is without fault
Come on, everyone has room to grow.

Smarter than Steven Hawking?
You should know who the whole audience is mocking.
Self-depriciation is fun and all,
but combined with arrogance just gives a long ways to fall.
