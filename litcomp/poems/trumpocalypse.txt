Trumpocolapse

They said it wasn't legit
That it was all a farce
"Look, he'll quit! It's a stunt!"
Well we'll see how real it is when I nuke Mars

Hail to classical economics, I say,
I'll crush Ted in a debate anyday
And as state by state fell under my rhetorical sun,
They had to concede it wasn't all for fun

All those who, throughout it all, made a mock of it
Are going to love what happens now it's the Trumpocolapse
